Edges:
[1,3],[1,2],[2,4],[2,5],[5,6],[6,7],[6,8],[8,9],[8,10],[10,11],[11,6],[9,12],[12,13],
[12,16],[13,14],[14,12],[13,15],[15,16],[16,11],[16,17]


6 test paths are needed for Edge Coverage:

[1,3]
[1,2,4]
[1,2,5,6,8,10,11,6,7]
[1,2,5,6,8,9,12,13,15,16,17]
[1,2,5,6,8,9,12,13,14,12,16,17]
[1,2,5,6,8,9,12,16,11,6,7]



test case:

[1,3]
Test case : startNumber = 3, endNumber = 1

[1,2,4]
test case:startNumber = 1, endNumber = 4

[1,2,5,6,8,10,11,6,7]
test case:startNumber = 1, endNumber = 4

[1,2,5,6,8,9,12,13,15,16,17]
test case: infeasable

[1,2,5,6,8,9,12,13,14,12,16,17]
test case:startNumber = 3, endNumber = 4

[1,2,5,6,8,9,12,16,11,6,7]
test case:startNumber = 1, endNumber = 1
